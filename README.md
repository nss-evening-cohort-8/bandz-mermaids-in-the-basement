# bandz-mermaids-in-the-basement

This was a group work exercise to get familiar with git procedure in a team setting.

It also gave us the opportunity to put to use the coding skills we've acquired in the first 4 weeks of class.

The exercise was to build a band webpage with each team member responsible for one of the pages.
